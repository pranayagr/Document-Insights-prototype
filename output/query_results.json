Each plan will include revenues, expenditures and other sources and uses with sufficient detail to identify trends and items with major impact. 2.

The following policies are designed to guarantee current and future projects are maintained at a quality level and capital projects do not restrict the County’s ability to provide basic services. The County must preserve its current physical assets and plan in an orderly manner for future capital investments, including operating costs associated with these projects. In addition to amenity improvements, the County must make the capital investment needed to support and enhance the delivery of basic services. This commitment becomes even more important because the demands for basic services biases funding priorities toward the operating services (sheriff’s office and recreation programs) versus infrastructure (streets and buildings), which could be an issue in the future. Capital expenditures include buildings, land, major equipment and other items which are of significant value and have a life greater than five years. Policies The planning, funding and maintenance of all capital projects will be based on the following policies: 1. **Bond Rating** – The County will maintain a strong bond rating consistent with other County goals. The County will maintain good communications with bond rating agencies about its financial condition. The County will follow a policy of full disclosure on every financial report and bond prospectus. 2. **Five Year Capital Plans** – Each Department with capital expenditures will develop and maintain five-year capital plans.
