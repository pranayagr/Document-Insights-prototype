"SECTION I: Basic Policy Statement

The Lubbock Chamber of Commerce (LCC) is committed to responsible financial management. The entire organization including the Board of Directors, Administrators, and Staff will work together to make certain that all financial matters of the organization are addressed with care, integrity, and in the best interest of LCC.

The policy and procedural guidelines contained in this handbook are designed to:

1. Protect the assets of LCC;
2. Ensure the maintenance of accurate records of LCC’s financial activities;
3. Provide a framework of operating standards and behavioral expectations; and,
4. Ensure compliance with federal, state, and local legal and reporting requirements.

In accordance with LCC Bylaws, the president has the responsibility for administering these policies and ensuring compliance with procedures that have been approved by the Board of Directors. Exceptions to written policies may only be made with the prior approval of the Finance Committee. Changes or amendments to these policies may be approved by the Board of Directors at any time. A complete review of the policies shall be conducted annually.

Every Director and every Administrator with financial related responsibility is expected to be familiar with and operate within the parameters of these policies and guidelines.

2009 Adopted by the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors

,SECTION II: Line of Authority,4
"The Board of Directors has the authority to execute any policies it deems to be in the best interest of the organization within the parameters of the organization’s articles of incorporation, bylaws, or federal, state, and local law. The Board of Directors, in compliance with Chamber bylaws, shall schedule an annual audit of the financial statements of LCC by an independent certified public accountant.",Board of Directors,4
The Executive Committee has responsibility for business in the interim between meetings of the Board of Directors. It shall supervise and attend to fiscal matters of LCC and may refer matters to a proper committee or to the Board of Directors.,Executive Committee,4
"The Treasurer has the authority to perform regular reviews of the organization’s financial activity; oversee the development of the annual budget; and oversee the allocation of investment deposits. The Executive Committee acts as the Finance Committee, unless otherwise directed by the Board of Directors.",Treasurer and The Finance Committee,4
The President has the authority to make spending decisions within the parameters of the approved budget; employ and terminate personnel; determine salary and bonus levels; create and amend operating procedures and controls; make decisions regarding the duties and accountabilities of personnel and the delegation of decision-making authority; enter into contractual agreements within board designated parameters.,President and Board Secretary,4
The CFO has whatever authority as may be designated by the President such as the authority to design the organization’s accounting system; make spending decisions within the parameters of the approved budget; make fixed asset purchase decisions within a certain dollar amount; make decisions regarding the allocation of expenses.,CFO,4
"Vice Presidents, Divisions and Program Directors have whatever authority as may be designated by the President, such as, the authority to make spending decisions within the parameters of the approved department or program budget.","Vice Presidents, Divisions and Program Directors",4
"LCC shall purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is serving at the request of LCC, as a Director, Officer, Employee, Agent, Staff Volunteer or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such.",SECTION III: Indemnity Policy,5
"Only cash necessary to meet anticipated day-to-day expenditures, plus a reasonable corpus for emergencies shall be kept available. Any excess cash shall be invested in a liquid, income-producing instrument or account as approved by the Finance Committee / Executive Committee. The investment objectives of LCC, in order of importance, shall be the safety of principal, liquidity, and a competitive rate of return.

**General Investment Guidelines**

The Finance Committee shall have primary responsibility for the administration of the investment policy and for establishing any specific guidelines as to the mix and quality of the investment account(s).

**Delegation of Responsibility**
- Should include internal groups/individuals, i.e., Board of Directors, Treasurer, Finance Committee, President and CFO.
- Should also include external groups such as investment managers, bank custodians and investment consultants.

**Reserve Policy**

LCC recognizes that it relies on revenue sources which may be variable beyond its control, but provides services that must be consistently delivered. In order to ensure continuity of LCC’s function in all divisions, LCC will maintain a board restricted reserve for each division and overall for LCC.",SECTION IV: Investment Policy,5
"LCC receives a broad variety of services from its members. These include liability insurance, health insurance, banking services, payroll services, office equipment and others. It will be the responsibility of Chamber staff to obtain these and similar services at the most effective cost. It is recognized, however, that a formal request for proposal is not always warranted.

When a Chamber officer, director or staff member is notified that a specific Chamber service is provided and can be provided competitively by a member who is not providing the service to LCC, a request for proposal for that service will be issued in advance of the next renewal date of",SECTION V: Policy for Services Provided by Members,5
the service to permit competitive bidding for the service. A request for proposal may also be issued any time that LCC President or a member of LCC’s Executive Committee believes that competition among members may improve the cost of the service.,Financial Policies,6
"Because LCC receives hundreds of requests to support, publicize, and help organize a variety of community events, the following policies shall govern Chamber responses to such requests. The policies are designed to help ensure careful consideration in the face of finite Chamber resources and to provide a basis for fairly assessing each request.

**Priorities**
When a commitment is made to support a community event at some level, priority will be given to those events that complement the mission and budget of LCC. Priority will also be given to events and programs sponsored by LCC’s community partners. Nevertheless, given the large number of these activities, LCC will not be able to participate in all of the events and programs of its partners, even though LCC recognizes the value.

**Financial Support**
Because LCC has limited resources, it should not be assumed by any civic organization or group that LCC has funds designated or automatically budgeted for investment in events outside of Chamber functions. Assistance provided by LCC ordinarily will be in the form of in-kind services, such as assistance in promoting and publicizing an event rather than donating funds that otherwise would support the mission of LCC. If such in-kind services are provided, LCC should be listed as a contributing sponsor of the event.

**Staff Support**
While LCC recognizes the importance of volunteerism and is itself dependent on volunteers to fulfill its mission, Chamber staff is unable to honor all requests for their participation on planning and fundraising committees and boards associated with community events and activities. If staff is obligated to attend unlimited numbers of outside meetings unrelated specifically to Chamber business, they are less able to further the mission of LCC.

**Chamber Sponsorships**
Given its limited resources to invest in outside events, programs, and activities, LCC must be selective in agreeing to sponsorships. Priorities as indicated above will rule decisions of this type. Once LCC has agreed to sponsor a specific event or activity, LCC should be listed as among sponsors but not made to appear as though it is hosting or planning the event. This policy is especially important when LCC has no control over the quality of the event or activity. Signed permission must be obtained from the LCC President for the use of its logo in connection with sponsorships.",SECTION VI: Involvement with Community Events,6
"SECTION VII: Criteria for Endorsements and Affinity Programs
The following is a description of criteria set by the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce (LCC) Board of Directors for affinity programs. To make this process as systematic as possible, LCC, its staff and volunteers follow the described set of criteria to begin negotiations with vendors before establishing a new affinity/value added program.",Financial Policies,7
"- The proposed program supports LCC's vision that it is a proactive, effective business advocate: recognized as a regional leader, and for sustaining the economic prosperity of our community.
- The Chamber’s mission is also supported: strengthen, promote and serve our business community.
- The program helps attract/recruit and retain Chamber members.
- The applicant or program sponsor is a member of LCC.
- The proposal fits or complements and does not overlap current product offerings.
- The program presents tangible economic benefits for Chamber members.",Chamber's Vision and Mission,7
- A company proposing an affinity program to the LCC must be an active member and in good standing for at least one year.,Eligibility,7
"- The proposal includes a realistic revenue projection against which this component of the program can be measured.
- The program compensates LCC for intangible expenses, including staff time, postage, marketing, etc.
- The program provides a positive cash flow annually to LCC or added value to Chamber members that supports a lower revenue marketing potential.",Revenue Stream,7
"- The program provides a valid opportunity for LCC and its members without placing LCC as endorser or program sponsor in competition with its members.
- To the extent that aspects of the program compete with Chamber members, the program has unique features that are not available at the local level.
- The vendor's method of sales does not negatively impact LCC's product sales.
- The vendor's product sales will not detract from current Chamber products or member investments.",Local Competition,7
"- The vendor does not rely on Chamber staff for marketing and customer service.
- The vendor has processes and procedures in place to ensure good customer relationships that reflect positively on LCC.",Marketing and Customer Service,7
"- The vendor has a proven business track record reflected in reliable letters of reference.
- If the vendor is a middleman, the organization providing the product has a proven business record reflected by reliable letters of reference.
- If a new company, the vendors, employees and managers have a history of reliability with respect to proposed product.
- The vendor has provided, as a part of the application, proof of its legal organizational structure.",Financial Policies,8
"- The proposal adequately describes the expected life cycle of the product and anticipated market behavior, including the projection of a certain number of early adopters, before the product would be accepted by general membership.
- The proposal defines specific goals of the product upon which a continued relationship with LCC will be based.
- The proposal contains measurable indicators of program success.
- The program is terminable on a specific date consistent with the nature of the product and the marketing plan and may be terminated for cause at any time for failure to meet projections or for any other cause detrimental to LCC or its image.
- The program does not require an exclusive relationship with LCC in the absence of extraordinary circumstances.",Product Timeline,8
Each proposed affinity/value added program will be reviewed in comparison to the above guidelines by a task force or staff review appointed for that purpose. Any affinity or value added program must be approved by the Executive Committee after consideration by a task force or proposed after staff review.,General,8

Credit Cards
- Credit cards are issued to certain staff members for purchases of low dollar value merchandise and services. While credit cards eliminate the cost of processing invoices and drafting checks for each vendor, they also create a corporate liability. For that reason, credit cards are used only for Chamber purposes and are subject to strict cardholder purchasing controls.
- The bank should accept requests to issue credit cards and set cardholder limits only from an authorized signer. In order to keep to a minimum the number of cards issued, the need for a credit card should be justified in writing and submitted to an authorized signer.
