    "question": "What is the procedure for financial approval outlined in the policies?",
    "answer": "The procedure for financial approval outlined in the policies involves several steps and roles:\n\n1. **Expenditure Approval**: The President has expenditure approval authority up to the parameters set by the annual operating budget as approved by the Board. Additionally, the President has single signature authority for expenditures up to and including $500. For expenditures over $500, two signatures are required—one from the President and one from a Board member. If the President is absent, two Board members' signatures are required.\n\n2. **Initiation and Approval**: Expenditure requests must be initiated in writing and approved by the President within specified authority. The CFO approves check requests after comparing them to supporting documentation.\n\n3. **Check Preparation and Signing**: The Accounting Assistant enters all disbursements in the accounting system. The CFO prints pre-numbered checks only with approved requests. Unsigned checks, along with support and request documentation, are presented to authorized check signers for their signatures. The President reviews all checks and supporting documentation before signing. Checks over $500 require two authorized signatures.\n\n4. **Mailing and Documentation**: The Customer Service Representative is responsible for mailing the checks along with supporting documentation. All disbursements, except petty cash, are made by check and accompanied by substantiating documentation.\n\n5. **Separation of Duties**: The check signer(s) must not be the person who writes checks or does the bookkeeping. Bank statements are reconciled by someone other than the check signer. Deposit reconciliations are prepared by a person other than the one recording the receipts.\n\n6. **Financial Reporting**: Detailed financial reports are provided to the Treasurer and Executive Committee, and summary reports are provided to the Board of Directors. Annual audits are conducted by an independent CPA.\n\nThese procedures ensure that financial transactions are properly authorized, documented, and reviewed to maintain accountability and compliance with organizational policies.",

The following policies are designed to guarantee current and future projects are maintained at a quality level and capital projects do not restrict the County’s ability to provide basic services. The County must preserve its current physical assets and plan in an orderly manner for future capital investments, including operating costs associated with these projects. In addition to amenity improvements, the County must make the capital investment needed to support and enhance the delivery of basic services. This commitment becomes even more important because the demands for basic services biases funding priorities toward the operating services (sheriff’s office and recreation programs) versus infrastructure (streets and buildings), which could be an issue in the future. Capital expenditures include buildings, land, major equipment and other items which are of significant value and have a life greater than five years. Policies The planning, funding and maintenance of all capital projects will be based on the following policies: 1. **Bond Rating** – The County will maintain a strong bond rating consistent with other County goals. The County will maintain good communications with bond rating agencies about its financial condition. The County will follow a policy of full disclosure on every financial report and bond prospectus. 2. **Five Year Capital Plans** – Each Department with capital expenditures will develop and maintain five-year capital plans.

The Chairperson is responsible for developing an appropriate response, which may include disqualification from voting and discussion, and any necessary remedial action.\n\n2. **Decision-Making Process**: The Board or committee member with the conflict should not be involved in any aspect of the decision-making process. They may be present and/or participate in discussions but refrain from voting, or they may be asked to leave for further discussions before the vote. The Board, committee, or working group must agree in majority on the option or combination of options to be taken in any given conflict of interest situation.\n\n3. **Documentation**: The official minutes of the meeting must record the potential conflict of interest and how it was avoided and/or dealt with.\n\n4. **Legal Counsel**: If there is a failure to agree on whether a conflict of interest exists and/or how it is to be managed, the Chairperson (or if the potential conflict of interest involves him or her, the vice-chairperson) may seek legal counsel.\n\n5. **Fairness and Transparency**: Decisions regarding the management of a conflict of interest must not only be fair but must be seen to be fair.\n\nThese measures ensure that conflicts of interest are managed successfully and transparently, maintaining the integrity of financial decisions within the organization.",

The Finance Committee will recommend these amendments to the Board of Directors, which must approve all additional programs or expansions.\n\n3. **Budget Approval and Management**:\n   - Commissioners approve the annual budget based on established revenue and expenditure limits. Departments must work within these limits and cannot exceed the approved budget without prior approval from the Commissioners.\n   - The County Manager may approve budget transfers between categories and departments within a fund, while Department Directors can request transfers within their department categories.\n\n4. **Revenue and Expenditure Policies**:\n   - Revenue projections include rate reviews, inflation increases, and frequency estimates. Expenditure preparations start with existing staff, adjusting for cost of living and benefits.\n   - Supplies and services are reviewed for efficiency, eliminating outdated programs, and identifying appropriate service levels.\n\n5. **Financial Controls and Reporting**:\n   - The Finance Department maintains budgetary controls to assist in identifying variances between actual and budgeted amounts.\n   - Monthly reports are prepared for Commissioners' review, including information on revenues, expenditures, and performance measures.\n\nThese guidelines ensure that the budgeting process is thorough, inclusive, and adaptable to changes in program needs or financial conditions.",

The following policies are designed to guarantee current and future projects are maintained at a quality level and capital projects do not restrict the County’s ability to provide basic services. The County must preserve its current physical assets and plan in an orderly manner for future capital investments, including operating costs associated with these projects. In addition to amenity improvements, the County must make the capital investment needed to support and enhance the delivery of basic services. This commitment becomes even more important because the demands for basic services biases funding priorities toward the operating services (sheriff’s office and recreation programs) versus infrastructure (streets and buildings), which could be an issue in the future. Capital expenditures include buildings, land, major equipment and other items which are of significant value and have a life greater than five years. Policies The planning, funding and maintenance of all capital projects will be based on the following policies: 1. **Bond Rating** – The County will maintain a strong bond rating consistent with other County goals. The County will maintain good communications with bond rating agencies about its financial condition. The County will follow a policy of full disclosure on every financial report and bond prospectus. 2. **Five Year Capital Plans** – Each Department with capital expenditures will develop and maintain five-year capital plans.

Vouchers must be submitted to the Administrative Assistant by the fifth working day after travel.\n\n3. **Mileage Reimbursement**: Mileage for trips to work in excess of five round trips per week due to specific emergency calls or additional shifts caused by staff shortages may be reimbursed. Mileage due to employer-directed conferences or special meetings can also be submitted for reimbursement at the standard IRS reimbursement rate per mile.\n\n4. **Review and Approval**: Requests for reimbursement of allowable expenses are turned in to the CFO, accompanied by documentation of explanation and/or original receipts. If the original receipt is unavailable, a signed letter detailing the expenditure must accompany the request. All reimbursements are reviewed by the CFO and approved by the President.\n\n5. **Petty Cash**: Expenses paid from petty cash must be supported by receipts containing specific information, such as date of payment, signature, amount paid, and description of expenditure. The CSR reconciles the petty cash fund as needed and submits a check request for reimbursement to the CFO.\n\n6. **Credit Card Expenses**: Employees must submit receipts for all expenses charged to company credit cards to the Finance Director within one week of the transaction. The Finance Director examines billings to ensure all charges are valid and notifies the Executive Director immediately of any incorrect charges.\n\nThese procedures ensure that expenses are properly documented, reviewed, and reimbursed in accordance with organizational policies.",

REIMBURSEMENT PROCEDURES: The Tribe/TDHE general ledger should be set up to account for specific program expenses. On a periodic basis (for example, weekly or monthly) the Finance department runs a schedule of NAHASDA Revenue and Expense report to determine the amount of IHBG grant funds that have been recorded to offset eligible NAHASDA expenses. Because the Tribe/TDHE seeks reimbursement after incurring and recording the program expenses, the difference between the recorded IHBG grant revenues and the recorded total eligible IHBG expenses is the amount of program expenses that the Tribe/TDHE needs to be reimbursed, either through eLOCCS or by drawing down from the IHBG investment account.",

Financial planning should be designed to ensure the delivery of needed services as defined by policy and the Comprehensive Plan. Policies The financial planning and subsequent budgeting for all funds will be based on the following policies: 1. Three-Year Plans – The County will prepare annually a three (3) year financial LRP for each fund. Each plan will include revenues, expenditures and other sources and uses with sufficient detail to identify trends and items with major impact. 2. Conservative Revenue Estimates – Revenue estimates should be prepared on a conservative basis to minimize the possibility that economic fluctuations could imperil ongoing service programs during the budget year. 3. Include Contingencies – Expenditure estimates should anticipate contingencies that are foreseeable. 4. Include Asset Management Plan on LRP – The five-year Asset Management Plan (AMP) will include equipment, major maintenance, and associated expenses of less than $100,000.

GRANT DRAWDOWN: Recipients of NAHASDA federal grant funds must draw funds following HUD’s specific procedures, with the use of eLOCCS system, which is HUD’s primary grant and subsidy disbursement system that handles disbursement and cash management for the majority of HUD grant programs, including IHBG, ICDBG, and NHHBG funds. Only eligible NAHASDA program expenses are paid with IHBG grant funds. To access eLOCCS, the Tribe/TDHE must register in Secure Systems to access the eLOCCS online. 1.
