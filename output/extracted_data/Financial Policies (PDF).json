        "I. FINANCIAL PLANNING POLICIES": "Introduction\nA long-range plan (LRP) that estimates revenue and expenditure activity in the County, as impacted by regional and national economies, is necessary to support the Commissioners and Community in the decisions they make regarding County services. This planning must recognize the effects of economic cycles on the demand for services and the County\u2019s Revenues. Financial planning should be designed to ensure the delivery of needed services as defined by policy and the Comprehensive Plan.\n\nPolicies\nThe financial planning and subsequent budgeting for all funds will be based on the following policies:\n\n1. Three-Year Plans \u2013 The County will prepare annually a three (3) year financial LRP for each fund. Each plan will include revenues, expenditures and other sources and uses with sufficient detail to identify trends and items with major impact.\n\n2. Conservative Revenue Estimates \u2013 Revenue estimates should be prepared on a conservative basis to minimize the possibility that economic fluctuations could imperil ongoing service programs during the budget year.\n\n3. Include Contingencies \u2013 Expenditure estimates should anticipate contingencies that are foreseeable.\n\n4. Include Asset Management Plan on LRP \u2013 The five-year Asset Management Plan (AMP) will include equipment, major maintenance, and associated expenses of less than $100,000. Major renovation or maintenance projects will be identified in the LRP."

Complex Regional Economic System \u2013 The County recognizes it is in a complex, regional economic system. The County should have the capacity to evaluate and anticipate changes in both regional and national economic systems, to engage in strategic financial and management planning. The purpose of these plans will be to allow the Commissioners and Citizens to evaluate the impact of the financial needs of these programs on the regional economy and to coordinate funding needs with all funds.\n\n7. Department Responsibilities \u2013 Department Directors and the Finance Department will share responsibility for the preparation of financial plans for operations and asset management needs. The County Manager will review and approve detailed work sheets used to generate the LRP. The Finance Department will assist in developing appropriate systems to monitor and update the LRP.\n\n8. Regular Status Reports \u2013 The Staff will continually update the LRP when significant changes are anticipated. The Staff may distribute the LRP to the Commissioners at any time to inform the Commissioners. The LRP will be submitted to the Commissioners for approval at least twice a year. The first update will follow the closing of the year and will include a final comparison of actual to budget for the completed year. The second report will be presented before the presentation of the annual budget and will include an update of the current budget and estimates.\n\n9. Rate Structures - The plans must disclose revenue assumptions including rate structures and consumption. The LRP will include annual rate increases based on inflation unless the Commissioners overrides this direction.\n\n10.

        "II. BUDGET POLICIES": "Introduction\nThe Staff is responsible for preparing, managing and reporting on the County\u2019s annual budget. This function follows the direction of the Commissioners.\n\nA. Budget Policies\nThe annual budget will be administered based on the following policies:\n\n1. Fiscal Year \u2013 The fiscal year (FY) of the County is the calendar year, January 1st \u2013 December 31st. The purpose of the LRP is to provide the Commissioners with a continuous budget update.\n\n2. Present a Balanced Budget to Commissioners \u2013 The County will pay for all current expenditures with current revenues. The County will avoid budgetary procedures that balance current expenditures at the expense of the meeting future years\u2019 expenses, such as postponing maintenance and other expenditures, accruing future years\u2019 revenues, or rolling over short term debt. The exceptions to this policy would be planned equipment purchases, operation maintenance and capital projects based on accumulated funding over the years.\n\n3. Increase Efficiency in All County Operations \u2013 The County Staff will identify programs to increase efficiency to provide long\u2013term cost savings to the County. This may include the use of technology, revised organizational structures or other tools which may be identified. Eliminating outdated practices is encouraged.\n\n4. Promote Investment in Our Future \u2013 The County Staff, whenever possible, will take a long-term view of investments (people and resources) and emphasize quality operations which encourage productivity for today and the future.\n\n5. Share Resources & Services \u2013 The County Staff will explore ways to share staff, training, resources and equipment/supplies to utilize resources more effectively.\n\n6. Identify Funding for New Service Levels \u2013 Proposals to add new services or increase existing services will be presented with revenue alternatives to fund or subsidize the new service levels. This includes initial costs and ongoing operations.\n\n7. Asset Management Plan \u2013 The budget will provide adequate maintenance of capital plant and equipment and for their orderly replacement.\n\n8. Employee Programs \u2013 The County recognizes employees are the most valuable asset of the organization and commits to fund this resource appropriately including adequate funding for all retirement systems, benefit packages and employee incentive programs including training."

Fund account is used as a control device to segregate financial resources and ensure that the segregated resources are used for their intended purposes. Cash reserves provide stability for operations and can cushion the impact to County programs during times of economic downturns. Reserve targets are established based on the type of Fund.\n\n- Operating funds will accumulate and maintain three months of operating reserves based on estimated personnel, supplies and services and AMP expenditures. Operating reserves allow for the efficient management of cash flow and the opportunity to expand services or fund one-time opportunities during the year.\n\nReserves for capital funds, including impact fee funds, are established based on the budgeting methodology. Capital fund budgets are based on the estimated current year ending cash balance for the next year. Subsequently the reserves are funded by the revenues restricted to capital funds:\n\n- Capital projects may include a contingency for unexpected expenditures.\n- Debt service fund reserves are based on required debt reserves established when debt is issued.\n- The County will establish and budget a contingency reserve in the General Fund to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a non-recurring nature, or to meet unexpected small increases in service delivery costs.\n- The priority of the County will be to maintain target reserves by individual funds based on the above target. The Commissioners may identify specific reserves on an individual basis. When a cash reserve deficit exists, the Commissioners will identify the specific fund to offset the deficit and a plan to increase the reserve in the fund."

Specific Use of Services \u2013 Charges for services that benefit specific users should recover full costs, including all direct costs, indirect costs, depreciation on capital plant and equipment, and General Fund overhead. Departments that impose fees or service chargers should prepare and periodically update cost-of-service studies for each such service.

        "VI. CAPITAL PLANNING & BUDGET POLICIES": "Introduction\nThe Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) has a significant impact on the image of the County. The following policies are designed to guarantee current and future projects are maintained at a quality level and capital projects do not restrict the County\u2019s ability to provide basic services. The County must preserve its current physical assets and plan in an orderly manner for future capital investments, including operating costs associated with these projects. In addition to amenity improvements, the County must make the capital investment needed to support and enhance the delivery of basic services. This commitment becomes even more important because the demands for basic services biases funding priorities toward the operating services (sheriff\u2019s office and recreation programs) versus infrastructure (streets and buildings), which could be an issue in the future. Capital expenditures include buildings, land, major equipment and other items which are of significant value and have a life greater than five years.\n\nPolicies\nThe planning, funding and maintenance of all capital projects will be based on the following policies:\n\n1. **Bond Rating** \u2013 The County will maintain a strong bond rating consistent with other County goals. The County will maintain good communications with bond rating agencies about its financial condition. The County will follow a policy of full disclosure on every financial report and bond prospectus.\n\n2. **Five Year Capital Plans** \u2013 Each Department with capital expenditures will develop and maintain five-year capital plans. This plan will include sources of funding and maintenance.\n\n3. **Citizen Involvement** \u2013 The CIP development process will provide for the full participation of any Citizen and or Committee appointed by Commissioners.\n\n4. **Details of the Plan** \u2013 The County will prepare, adopt and update annually a County five-year CIP that identifies Department needs for capital replacement and additions. The CIP lists all anticipated capital expenditures, total estimated cost, the year in which it will be started, the amount expected to be expended in each year, and the proposed method of financing these expenditures. Methods of financing can include bonding, assessment of districts, pay-as-you-go (taxes, current revenues, cash balances), or others.\n\n5. **Include Future Maintenance** \u2013 As a part of the annual Capital Budget, the County will identify and include full costs of future maintenance needs and operating costs of new capital facilities and equipment prior to funding as part of the annual Capital Budget. It is essential to recognize many smaller projects can have a significant impact on the existing Staff and maintenance levels when you consider the total impact. All capital projects will identify the maintenance requirements in terms of staffing (hours per week) and supplies and services."

        "Identify Project Funding": "The Staff will identify the estimated costs and potential funding sources for each capital project proposal before it is submitted to Commissioners for approval. This proposal will include capital construction as well as ongoing maintenance."
      },
      {
        "Asset Management Plan (AMP)": "The County will develop an AMP that protects capital investments and will minimize future maintenance and replacement costs. The County will maintain accurate information on the condition, life span use and replacement cost of their capital assets to assist in long term planning. The AMP will also indicate future major repairs and their costs, utility costs and other operating costs.\n\na. Equipment Replacement \u2013 The County will estimate its equipment replacement (items over $10,000 with a life greater than one year) and maintenance needs for the next five years, with updated projections each year. From this projection, a maintenance and replacement schedule will be developed and followed.\n\nb. Cash for Equipment \u2013 Equipment replacement should be financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. Equipment should be replaced on a useful life basis considering optimum trade in value and maintenance costs."

        "Planned Funding": "The budget will provide sufficient funding for adequate maintenance and scheduled replacement and enhancement of capital plant and equipment. Whenever the Amp identifies there is a significant discrepancy between the need to maintain/modernize County infrastructure of facilities and the funds available for such improvements, the Staff will prepare and present to strategies for meeting this need to the Commissioners. The LRP of the County will include all costs identified in the AMP."

        "Renovation": "Although the annual operating budget should provide for adequate maintenance of capital plant and equipment, it is possible that even if this maintenance is provided a major expenditure will be required. It is appropriate to consider these types of major expenditures when developing the CIP."
      },
      {
        "Capital Priority": "In general, the following guidelines will be used to identify capital priorities: safety, completing existing projects, maintaining of existing capital facilities, extensions of existing systems and new projects. Maintenance should be given priory over acquisition of new facilities unless a cost-benefit analysis indicates the contrary. State, Federal and Local mandates or new service demands may require acquisition of new facilities or new construction even when maintenance needs are not fully met. Unique opportunities may arise, which should be considered as a priority, particularly if there is Community support for acquisition. Maintenance of facilities should take priority over operating programs if deferring maintenance will result in great costs to restore or replace neglected facilities."

        "Impact on County Policies and Community": "The County will identify the ongoing costs and benefits that may be associated with each capital project to determine its effect on other County policies and the Community."

        "Alternate Funding": "Assessment district financing is appropriate for those areas of the County that are retroactively installing physical plant features which are normally required by subdivision standards at the time of development, or which have been funded by another assessment district. Such physical plant features include curbs, gutters, sidewalks, streetlights, and sewers. Assessment districts are also appropriate in cases where these types of physical plant features are being upgraded for the benefit of property owners in the area. Unless otherwise directed by the Commissioners, assessment districts will include all costs associated with the project, including overhead and indirect costs, including but not limited to financing, and administrative costs. The County will take actions to ensure financial risks to the County are minimized."

        "Long Term Debt": "A liability that places a future contractual or other obligation against future revenues of the County. For example, long term debt includes liabilities arising from bonds, lease purchase agreements and installment purchase contracts.\n\n- **Use of Capital** \u2013 The County will confine long-term borrowing to capital improvements or projects that cannot be financed from current revenues.\n\n- **Life of Bonds Not to Exceed 75% of Project Life** \u2013 When the County finances capital projects by issuing bonds, it will pay back the bonds within a period not to exceed 75% of the expected useful life of the project.\n\n- **Debt Restrictions** \u2013 The County will not use long-term debt for current or annual operations.\n\n- **Legal Debt Limits** \u2013 The County will review its legal debt limitation established by the State Charter at least annually. Debt limits will be included in the statistics sections of the Financial Plan and Financial Report."
