On a monthly basis, the Finance Director shall provide a report that shows the cash position from all sources that are accounted for in the cash accounts and investment accounts, along with bank and investment statements. The",CASH MANAGEMENT POLICY,6
"TRIBE/TDHE’s cash and investment funds may be from a variety of sources such as NAHASDA IHBG funds, non-restricted funds, unused donations, and program income.

• Book cash and investment position reports;

• Cash flow projections for the following month;

• Investments statements from the depository or the broker that show the activities of the accounts, such as amounts deposited and withdrawn, investment revenues, fees, and gains or losses on investment.

If at any time, the Finance Director finds the TRIBE/TDHE in a potential cash deficiency situation, the Council/Board and the Executive Director must be notified immediately.

Any cost allocable to a particular Federal award may not be charged to other Federal awards to overcome fund deficiencies, to avoid restrictions imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal awards, or for other reasons. For example, the TRIBE/TDHE shall not divert funds between programs and/or activities, even when such programs/activities are each assisted by HUD (for example, the HUD-funded Indian Housing Block Grant (“IHBG”) and Indian Community Development Block Grant (“ICDBG”) programs.",General,7
"a. Budget Responsibility and Adoption:

The TRIBE/TDHE’s annual budget represents a financial plan for management to carry out the objectives of the TRIBE/TDHE’s affordable housing activities. The TRIBE/TDHE’s Executive Director, Finance Manager and managers are responsible for preparing the annual budget, and are responsible for presenting the annual budget to the Council/Board for final approval.

Total projected revenues or sources or uses of funds are identified and included in the annual budget, allowing for inclusion of all funding sources and all funding outlays during the budget period. In addition to grant revenue, other sources of funds, such as debts (for example, Title VI loans) are included in the annual budget to accurately portray total resources used to fund operating and capital plans in the fiscal year, and expenditure budgets for grant awards are in compliance with the grant agreement. The Council/Board approves the annual Indian Housing Plan and those approved activities are included in the TRIBE/TDHE’s annual housing program budget.",10. BUDGET ADMINISTRATION,7
"The budget process should begin early in the fiscal year to allow the Executive Director, the Finance Director, and the department managers to engage in the process and present the budget to the Council/Board for approval.

In accordance with the NAHASDA regulations, the Indian Housing Plan (IHP) is due 75 days prior to the TRIBE/TDHE’s fiscal year end, therefore, the TRIBE/TDHE should have the IHP prepared and approved ahead of time in order for the IHP to be incorporated in the overall housing budget for the next fiscal year.

Once the budget has been approved, the Finance Director shall input the approved budget in the accounting system for the new fiscal year.",Budget Preparation Timing,8
"Program managers shall be responsible for managing transactions that are charged against their department budgets, and are accountable for ensuring their department revenues and expenses posted against their department budget are accurate, and are responsible for providing justifications on budget variables.

The budget for specific grant awards provides a spending plan against which fiscal and program performance can be measured. Therefore, the TRIBE/TDHE’s accounting system must be set up in a manner that allows the TRIBE/TDHE to produce financial reports that compare expenditures with budget amounts in compliance with the Federal award agreement.",Budget Management and Report,8
"The TRIBE/TDHE’s purchases shall be governed by its Council/Board approved procurement policy, which establishes guidelines to ensure reasonable buying practices and competition, quality and integrity.",PURCHASE OF GOODS AND SERVICES,8

• Be necessary, reasonable, and allocable;

• Conform to any limitations or exclusions ;

The TRIBE/TDHE shall have written procedures for determining the allowability of costs that comply with the terms and conditions of the federal award as outlined in this section.",General,9

b. Payments shall be made as expeditiously as practicable.
As a federal grant, the NAHASDA funds must comply with the Uniform Guidance requirement cited in 200.302(6), which requires written procedures to implement the requirements of 200.305 Payments. The written procedures on 200.305 Payments are part of the Tribes/TDHE’s Financial Management Policy.

GRANT DRAWDOWN: Recipients of NAHASDA federal grant funds must draw funds following HUD’s specific procedures, with the use of eLOCCS system, which is HUD’s primary grant and subsidy disbursement system that handles disbursement and cash management for the majority of HUD grant programs, including IHBG, ICDBG, and NHHBG funds. Only eligible NAHASDA program expenses are paid with IHBG grant funds.

To access eLOCCS, the Tribe/TDHE must register in Secure Systems to access the eLOCCS online.

1. Submit a HUD-27054 LOCCS Access Authorization form, which will specify the Business Partner(s) and HUD Programs you are authorized to access within eLOCCS. Each eLOCCS user must submit a HUD-27054.

- The form specifies the Business Partner(s) and HUD Programs the user is authorized to access within eLOCCS.
- A Tribe may allow multiple authorized users to query or draw down funds.
- The form is to be approved by the recipient’s or grantee’s Executive Director, Administrator or the President of the Tribe.
- Keep a copy and send a NOTARIZED copy to HUD.

b. use the list and copies of the invoices as supporting documentation for the eLOCCS draw; and
c. staple copies of the invoices to the HUD 50080 form that has the total amount requested, and file.",The LOCCS Program Area = IHBG Program Name = INDIAN HOUSING BLOCK GRANT,22
"The NAHASDA program regulations (1000.58) allow Tribes/TDHEs to receive advance payments of their entire IHBG block grant for the purpose of investing grant funds.

c. No outstanding findings as a result of a HUD audit, Inspector General audits, or HUD Monitoring review;",II. ADVANCE IHBG BLOCK GRANT PAYMENT FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES:,22
"d. No other issues documented by the Area ONAP.

3. Invested IHBG funds must be held in one or more accounts separate from other funds for the Tribe/TDHE. Each investment fund account must be subject to a depository agreement approved by HUD. The Tribe/TDHE shall use the following HUD approved depository agreements:
   a. Form HUD-52736A (11/2013): For investments held in bank accounts;
   b. Form HUD-52736B (11/213): For investments managed by brokers/dealers.

4. The Tribe/TDHE must invest in interest bearing accounts and in eligible investment instruments pursuant to 24 CFR 1000.58, which consist of:

5. Invested advance payments must be insured by the United States or fully collateralized to ensure protection of the funds, even in the event of bank failure. Collateralization shall consist of identifiable U.S. Government securities as prescribed by HUD and specific authority contained in the agreement permitting HUD to exercise its rights pursuant to 24 CFR § 1000.60.

6. The Tribe/TDHE is exempted from maintaining advance payments in interest bearing accounts if:
   a. The Tribe/TDHE receives less than $120,000 in federal awards per year;
   b. The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $500 per year;
   c. The depository requires an unreasonably high minimum average or balance for the Tribe/TDHE to maintain.",General,23
"Tribes/TDHEs who are not eligible, or who do not choose to receive payment on their entire IHBG grant funds in advance for investment purposes, may request",III. ADVANCE PAYMENT REQUEST FOR INCURRED EXPENSES:,23
"advance payment via eLOCCS for eligible expenses incurred, but not yet paid for by the Tribe/TDHE. The requests may be made as often as is needed with eLOCCS.

The timing and amount of the advance payments must be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the Tribe/TDHE for eligible program expenses that have been incurred, but not yet paid. To ensure timely distribution of funds, the Tribe/TDHE should request IHBG funds from eLOCCS after invoices have been verified and have been successfully processed and ready for payment. Once the funds are received, the Tribe/TDHE will be able to distribute payment to the vendors right away.",General,24
"The Tribe/TDHE may seek reimbursement for incurred, eligible expenses in two ways:

a. eLOCCS REQUEST FOR EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT: The Tribe/TDHE may make reimbursement requests through the eLOCCS as often as it needs the funds to reimburse itself for eligible expenses incurred and paid for with available working capital.

b. IHBG INVESTMENT WITHDRAWAL FOR EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT: If the Tribe has been approved to draw down its entire IHBG funds for investment, it will periodically need to draw from the investment account to pay for the NAHASDA related expenses it has incurred.

c. REIMBURSEMENT PROCEDURES: The Tribe/TDHE general ledger should be set up to account for specific program expenses. On a periodic basis (for example, weekly or monthly) the Finance department runs a schedule of NAHASDA Revenue and Expense report to determine the amount of IHBG grant funds that have been recorded to offset eligible NAHASDA expenses. Because the Tribe/TDHE seeks reimbursement after incurring and recording the program expenses, the difference between the recorded IHBG grant revenues and the recorded total eligible IHBG expenses is the amount of program expenses that the Tribe/TDHE needs to be reimbursed, either through eLOCCS or by drawing down from the IHBG investment account.",IV.

,APPENDIX 3: ALLOWABLE COSTS POLICY AND PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS OF 200.302(B)(7),25
"In accordance with NAHASDA regulation at 1000.26, Tribe/TDHE must comply with the requirements of Title 2 CFR 200 Uniform Guidance in regards to the administrative requirements and principles for determining allowable costs applicable to the administration of the IHBG award.

A Tribe/TDHE’s financial management system, in accordance with 200.302(b)(7), must include written procedures for determining the allowability of costs in accordance with Subpart E – Cost Principles. This policy and procedures define the allowable costs on the use of the IHBG grant for the Tribe/TDHE and the sub-recipients. Costs include allowable direct and allocable indirect costs.",I. PURPOSE,25
"Allowable costs are those that:

- are necessary and reasonable;
- are allocable;
- conform to any limitations or exclusions in the IHBG award;
- consistent with policies and procedures;
- follow accounting practices and standards;
- treated consistently throughout the IHBG program;

The Finance Director and program directors are responsible for monitoring the IHBG award and that all costs charged to their program budgets are accurate.",II. DETERMINING ALLOWABLE COSTS,25
"Direct costs are those costs that can be identified specifically with a particular Federal award, such as IHBG, or other internally or externally funded activity, or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. Whether a cost is considered Direct or Indirect is determined by the Federal program and what it typically considers to be a direct cost versus indirect costs. The Tribe/TDHE should determine what costs it considers to be a direct cost or indirect cost and apply treatment of those costs consistently.",III. DIRECT COSTS,25
"Indirect Facilities and Administration (F&A) costs are incurred for common or joint objectives and not readily assignable or cannot be identified specifically with a particular project without effort disproportionate to the results achieved.

Typical examples of indirect (F&A) costs for many nonprofit organizations may include depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining the office building, and general administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, and accounting.",IV. INDIRECT (F&A) COSTS:,26
"With respect to the items of costs listed in 2 CFR 200.407 that require prior approval, specific to NAHASDA1000.(b)(1), these costs are allowable without the prior approval of HUD to the extent that they comply with the general policies and principles of 2 CFR 200.

If a TRIBE/TDHE is awarded other federal grants that do not specifically allow written prior approval, the reasonableness and allocability of certain items of costs may be difficult to determine, therefore, in order to avoid subsequent disallowance or dispute based on unreasonableness and unallocability, 200.407 of the Uniform Guidance lists items of costs that the TRIBE/TDHE may seek prior approval in advance of the incurrence of the special or unusual costs.",V. PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL (PRIOR APPROVAL),26
"Specific items of costs commonly incurred in the administration of the IHBG award, what are considered allowable, unallowable, or costs that are generally unallowable, but with exceptions, are listed in Subpart E – Cost Principles: General Provisions for Selected Items of Costs from 200-420-200.475. In addition, the TRIBE/TDHE should review HUD’s guidance on items of costs it explicitly disallows under the NAHASDA program, even when the items of costs may be allowed with prior approval.",VI.
