    "question": "What is the procedure for financial approval outlined in the policies?",
    "answer": "The procedure for financial approval outlined in the policies involves several steps and roles:\n\n1. **Expenditure Approval**: The President has expenditure approval authority up to the parameters set by the annual operating budget as approved by the Board. Additionally, the President has single signature authority for expenditures up to and including $500. For expenditures over $500, two signatures are required\u2014one from the President and one from a Board member. If the President is absent, two Board members' signatures are required.\n\n2. **Initiation and Approval**: Expenditure requests must be initiated in writing and approved by the President within specified authority. The CFO approves check requests after comparing them to supporting documentation.\n\n3. **Check Preparation and Signing**: The Accounting Assistant enters all disbursements in the accounting system. The CFO prints pre-numbered checks only with approved requests. Unsigned checks, along with support and request documentation, are presented to authorized check signers for their signatures. The President reviews all checks and supporting documentation before signing. Checks over $500 require two authorized signatures.\n\n4. **Mailing and Documentation**: The Customer Service Representative is responsible for mailing the checks along with supporting documentation. All disbursements, except petty cash, are made by check and accompanied by substantiating documentation.\n\n5. **Separation of Duties**: The check signer(s) must not be the person who writes checks or does the bookkeeping. Bank statements are reconciled by someone other than the check signer. Deposit reconciliations are prepared by a person other than the one recording the receipts.\n\n6. **Financial Reporting**: Detailed financial reports are provided to the Treasurer and Executive Committee, and summary reports are provided to the Board of Directors. Annual audits are conducted by an independent CPA.\n\nThese procedures ensure that financial transactions are properly authorized, documented, and reviewed to maintain accountability and compliance with organizational policies.",

    "question": "How does the organization handle conflicts of interest in financial decisions?",
    "answer": "The organization handles conflicts of interest in financial decisions through several measures:\n\n1. **Disclosure and Management**: Board or committee members must disclose any actual, perceived, or potential conflicts of interest to the Chairperson and, where appropriate, to all Board or committee members. The Chairperson is responsible for developing an appropriate response, which may include disqualification from voting and discussion, and any necessary remedial action.\n\n2. **Decision-Making Process**: The Board or committee member with the conflict should not be involved in any aspect of the decision-making process. They may be present and/or participate in discussions but refrain from voting, or they may be asked to leave for further discussions before the vote. The Board, committee, or working group must agree in majority on the option or combination of options to be taken in any given conflict of interest situation.\n\n3. **Documentation**: The official minutes of the meeting must record the potential conflict of interest and how it was avoided and/or dealt with.\n\n4. **Legal Counsel**: If there is a failure to agree on whether a conflict of interest exists and/or how it is to be managed, the Chairperson (or if the potential conflict of interest involves him or her, the vice-chairperson) may seek legal counsel.\n\n5. **Fairness and Transparency**: Decisions regarding the management of a conflict of interest must not only be fair but must be seen to be fair.\n\nThese measures ensure that conflicts of interest are managed successfully and transparently, maintaining the integrity of financial decisions within the organization.",

    "question": "What are the guidelines for budgeting and budget revisions?",
    "answer": "The guidelines for budgeting and budget revisions are as follows:\n\n1. **Annual Budget Process**: \n   - The budget should be designed to ensure efficient and prudent use of resources. It involves planning and preparation by management and staff.\n   - The Administrative Assistant, supported by the Executive Director, presents an annual budget to the Finance Committee one month before the fiscal year ends. After approval by the Finance Committee and Executive Committee, it is presented to the Board of Directors for review and approval during its July meeting.\n   - The budget is developed based on historical and projected costs for each program, with input from all involved parties.\n\n2. **Budget Amendments**:\n   - If a Nonprofit Organization desires to add or expand programs, a budget amendment may be proposed. The Finance Committee will recommend these amendments to the Board of Directors, which must approve all additional programs or expansions.\n\n3. **Budget Approval and Management**:\n   - Commissioners approve the annual budget based on established revenue and expenditure limits. Departments must work within these limits and cannot exceed the approved budget without prior approval from the Commissioners.\n   - The County Manager may approve budget transfers between categories and departments within a fund, while Department Directors can request transfers within their department categories.\n\n4. **Revenue and Expenditure Policies**:\n   - Revenue projections include rate reviews, inflation increases, and frequency estimates. Expenditure preparations start with existing staff, adjusting for cost of living and benefits.\n   - Supplies and services are reviewed for efficiency, eliminating outdated programs, and identifying appropriate service levels.\n\n5. **Financial Controls and Reporting**:\n   - The Finance Department maintains budgetary controls to assist in identifying variances between actual and budgeted amounts.\n   - Monthly reports are prepared for Commissioners' review, including information on revenues, expenditures, and performance measures.\n\nThese guidelines ensure that the budgeting process is thorough, inclusive, and adaptable to changes in program needs or financial conditions.",

    "question": "Describe the process and requirements for employee expense reimbursement",
    "answer": "The process and requirements for employee expense reimbursement are as follows:\n\n1. **Documentation and Submission**: Employees must submit a travel voucher form to document all travel and related expenses, such as mileage, parking, tolls, and meals. This form serves as a request for reimbursement and must include details like date, location visited, mileage, purpose of travel, and costs of other travel-related expenses. Receipts must be attached to the voucher, and any voucher submitted without receipts must be approved.\n\n2. **Approval Process**: The travel voucher must indicate the program benefiting from the travel. If costs pertain to more than one program, totals for each program must be indicated. Meal expenses exceeding the per diem allowance require the Executive Director's signature. Vouchers must be submitted to the Administrative Assistant by the fifth working day after travel.\n\n3. **Mileage Reimbursement**: Mileage for trips to work in excess of five round trips per week due to specific emergency calls or additional shifts caused by staff shortages may be reimbursed. Mileage due to employer-directed conferences or special meetings can also be submitted for reimbursement at the standard IRS reimbursement rate per mile.\n\n4. **Review and Approval**: Requests for reimbursement of allowable expenses are turned in to the CFO, accompanied by documentation of explanation and/or original receipts. If the original receipt is unavailable, a signed letter detailing the expenditure must accompany the request. All reimbursements are reviewed by the CFO and approved by the President.\n\n5. **Petty Cash**: Expenses paid from petty cash must be supported by receipts containing specific information, such as date of payment, signature, amount paid, and description of expenditure. The CSR reconciles the petty cash fund as needed and submits a check request for reimbursement to the CFO.\n\n6. **Credit Card Expenses**: Employees must submit receipts for all expenses charged to company credit cards to the Finance Director within one week of the transaction. The Finance Director examines billings to ensure all charges are valid and notifies the Executive Director immediately of any incorrect charges.\n\nThese procedures ensure that expenses are properly documented, reviewed, and reimbursed in accordance with organizational policies.",
