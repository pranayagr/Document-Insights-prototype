"SECTION I: Basic Policy Statement The Lubbock Chamber of Commerce (LCC) is committed to responsible financial management. The entire organization including the Board of Directors, Administrators, and Staff will work together to make certain that all financial matters of the organization are addressed with care, integrity, and in the best interest of LCC. The policy and procedural guidelines contained in this handbook are designed to: 1. Protect the assets of LCC; 2. Ensure the maintenance of accurate records of LCC’s financial activities; 3. Provide a framework of operating standards and behavioral expectations; and, 4. Ensure compliance with federal, state, and local legal and reporting requirements. In accordance with LCC Bylaws, the president has the responsibility for administering these policies and ensuring compliance with procedures that have been approved by the Board of Directors. Exceptions to written policies may only be made with the prior approval of the Finance Committee. Changes or amendments to these policies may be approved by the Board of Directors at any time. A complete review of the policies shall be conducted annually. Every Director and every Administrator with financial related responsibility is expected to be familiar with and operate within the parameters of these policies and guidelines. 2009 Adopted by the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors 2011 Updates made after the 2011 audits. Next Board review date will be in 2014. 2013 Reviewed / Updated by staff. 2014 Board Review. 2014 Board Review. 2019 Reviewed / Undated by Staff","{""chunk_id"": 2, ""topic"": ""Financial Policies"", ""source"": ""a_2.1_financial_policy_manual_lubbock_chamber_of_commerce_11.19"", ""page"": 3}"

Any excess cash shall be invested in a liquid, income-producing instrument or account as approved by the Finance Committee / Executive Committee.

In order to ensure continuity of LCC’s function in all divisions, LCC will maintain a board restricted reserve for each division and overall for LCC.","{""chunk_id"": 10, ""topic"": ""SECTION IV: Investment Policy"", ""source"": ""a_2.1_financial_policy_manual_lubbock_chamber_of_commerce_11.19"", ""page"": 5}"
"LCC receives a broad variety of services from its members. These include liability insurance, health insurance, banking services, payroll services, office equipment and others. It will be the responsibility of Chamber staff to obtain these and similar services at the most effective cost. It is recognized, however, that a formal request for proposal is not always warranted.

"Because LCC receives hundreds of requests to support, publicize, and help organize a variety of community events, the following policies shall govern Chamber responses to such requests. The policies are designed to help ensure careful consideration in the face of finite Chamber resources and to provide a basis for fairly assessing each request. **Priorities** When a commitment is made to support a community event at some level, priority will be given to those events that complement the mission and budget of LCC. Priority will also be given to events and programs sponsored by LCC’s community partners. Nevertheless, given the large number of these activities, LCC will not be able to participate in all of the events and programs of its partners, even though LCC recognizes the value. **Financial Support** Because LCC has limited resources, it should not be assumed by any civic organization or group that LCC has funds designated or automatically budgeted for investment in events outside of Chamber functions. Assistance provided by LCC ordinarily will be in the form of in-kind services, such as assistance in promoting and publicizing an event rather than donating funds that otherwise would support the mission of LCC. If such in-kind services are provided, LCC should be listed as a contributing sponsor of the event. **Staff Support** While LCC recognizes the importance of volunteerism and is itself dependent on volunteers to fulfill its mission, Chamber staff is unable to honor all requests for their participation on planning and fundraising committees and boards associated","{""chunk_id"": 13, ""topic"": ""SECTION VI: Involvement with Community Events"", ""source"": ""a_2.1_financial_policy_manual_lubbock_chamber_of_commerce_11.19"", ""page"": 6}"
"provided, LCC should be listed as a contributing sponsor of the event. **Staff Support** While LCC recognizes the importance of volunteerism and is itself dependent on volunteers to fulfill its mission, Chamber staff is unable to honor all requests for their participation on planning and fundraising committees and boards associated with community events and activities. If staff is obligated to attend unlimited numbers of outside meetings unrelated specifically to Chamber business, they are less able to further the mission of LCC. **Chamber Sponsorships** Given its limited resources to invest in outside events, programs, and activities, LCC must be selective in agreeing to sponsorships. Priorities as indicated above will rule decisions of this type. Once LCC has agreed to sponsor a specific event or activity, LCC should be listed as among sponsors but not made to appear as though it is hosting or planning the event. This policy is especially important when LCC has no control over the quality of the event or activity. Signed permission must be obtained from the LCC President for the use of its logo in connection with sponsorships.","{""chunk_id"": 14, ""topic"": ""SECTION VI: Involvement with Community Events"", ""source"": ""a_2.1_financial_policy_manual_lubbock_chamber_of_commerce_11.19"", ""page"": 6}"
"SECTION VII: Criteria for Endorsements and Affinity Programs The following is a description of criteria set by the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce (LCC) Board of Directors for affinity programs.

"- The proposal includes a realistic revenue projection against which this component of the program can be measured. - The program compensates LCC for intangible expenses, including staff time, postage, marketing, etc. - The program provides a positive cash flow annually to LCC or added value to Chamber members that supports a lower revenue marketing potential.","{""chunk_id"": 18, ""topic"": ""Revenue Stream"", ""source"": ""a_2.1_financial_policy_manual_lubbock_chamber_of_commerce_11.19"", ""page"": 7}"

Separation of Duties Within LCC’s financial management and reporting system, a number of checks and balances have been established. Given the small size of LCC staff, there are limitations in our ability to provide a complete separation of duties and responsibilities. We believe, however, that through the combination of a sound accounting system, regular oversight by management, the Executive Committee, the Board of Directors and the following policies, we can achieve sufficient separation of duties and responsibilities. - The check signer(s) must not be the person who writes checks or who does the bookkeeping. - Bank statements are reconciled by someone other than the check signer. - Deposit reconciliations are prepared by a person other than the","{""chunk_id"": 24, ""topic"": ""FINANCIAL CONTROLS AND OPERATING PROCEDURES"", ""source"": ""a_2.1_financial_policy_manual_lubbock_chamber_of_commerce_11.19"", ""page"": 9}"

"Introduction A long-range plan (LRP) that estimates revenue and expenditure activity in the County, as impacted by regional and national economies, is necessary to support the Commissioners and Community in the decisions they make regarding County services. This planning must recognize the effects of economic cycles on the demand for services and the County’s Revenues. Financial planning should be designed to ensure the delivery of needed services as defined by policy and the Comprehensive Plan. Policies The financial planning and subsequent budgeting for all funds will be based on the following policies: 1. Three-Year Plans – The County will prepare annually a three (3) year financial LRP for each fund. Each plan will include revenues, expenditures and other sources and uses with sufficient detail to identify trends and items with major impact. 2. Conservative Revenue Estimates – Revenue estimates should be prepared on a conservative basis to minimize the possibility that economic fluctuations could imperil ongoing service programs during the budget year. 3. Include Contingencies – Expenditure estimates should anticipate contingencies that are foreseeable. 4. Include Asset Management Plan on LRP – The five-year Asset Management Plan (AMP) will include equipment, major maintenance, and associated expenses of less than $100,000. Major renovation or maintenance projects will be identified in the LRP.","{""chunk_id"": 1, ""topic"": ""I. FINANCIAL PLANNING POLICIES"", ""source"": ""Financial Policies (PDF)"", ""page"": 1}"

Use Proven Methods – The County will constantly test both its planning methodology and use of planning tools to provide information that is timely, accurate and widely disseminated to Citizens and Staff. 6. Complex Regional Economic System – The County recognizes it is in a complex, regional economic system. The County should have the capacity to evaluate and anticipate changes in both regional and national economic systems, to engage in strategic financial and management planning. The purpose of these plans will be to allow the Commissioners and Citizens to evaluate the impact of the financial needs of these programs on the regional economy and to coordinate funding needs with all funds. 7. Department Responsibilities – Department Directors and the Finance Department will share responsibility for the preparation of financial plans for operations and asset management needs. The County Manager will review and approve detailed work sheets used to generate the LRP. The Finance Department will assist in developing appropriate systems to monitor and update the LRP. 8. Regular Status Reports – The Staff will continually update the LRP when significant changes are anticipated. The Staff may distribute the LRP to the Commissioners at any time to inform the Commissioners. The LRP will be submitted to the Commissioners for approval at least twice a year.

The purpose of the LRP is to provide the Commissioners with a continuous budget update. 2. Present a Balanced Budget to Commissioners – The County will pay for all current expenditures with current revenues. The County will avoid budgetary procedures that balance current expenditures at the expense of the meeting future years’ expenses, such as postponing maintenance and other expenditures, accruing future years’ revenues, or rolling over short term debt. The exceptions to this policy would be planned equipment purchases, operation maintenance and capital projects based on accumulated funding over the years. 3. Increase Efficiency in All County Operations – The County Staff will identify programs to increase efficiency to provide long–term cost savings to the County. This may include the use of technology, revised organizational structures or other tools which may be identified. Eliminating outdated practices is encouraged. 4.

"Cash reserve policies directly relate to fund accounting.

Operating reserves allow for the efficient management of cash flow and the opportunity to expand services or fund one-time opportunities during the year. Reserves for capital funds, including impact fee funds, are established based on the budgeting methodology. Capital fund budgets are based on the estimated current year ending cash balance for the next year. Subsequently the reserves are funded by the revenues restricted to capital funds: - Capital projects may include a contingency for unexpected expenditures. - Debt service fund reserves are based on required debt reserves established when debt is issued. - The County will establish and budget a contingency reserve in the General Fund to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a non-recurring nature, or to meet unexpected small increases in service delivery costs. - The priority of the County will be to maintain target reserves by individual funds based on the above target.

"Introduction The County must consider its discretionary revenues as a group rather than in isolation. Both individual revenues and the total package must be viewed in the context of broader County goals. The County must be sensitive to the balance between the need for services and the County’s ability to raise fees, charges and taxes to support County services. As much as is possible and feasible, County services that provide private benefit should be paid by fees and charger to provide maximum flexibility in use of general taxes to meet the cost of broader public services. Policies Revenues and rates in the LRP and annual budget will be based on the following policies: 1. Specific Use of Services – Charges for services that benefit specific users should recover full costs, including all direct costs, indirect costs, depreciation on capital plant and equipment, and General Fund overhead. Departments that impose fees or service chargers should prepare and periodically update cost-of-service studies for each such service. Competing County policies may dictate a subsidy of a portion of the costs of such services. 2. Diversify Revenue – The County should strive to diversify its revenues to maintain needed services during periods of declining economic activity. 3. Recapture Investment – The revenue structure should be designed to recapture for the County some of the financial benefits resulting from County sponsored programs or Community investments. 4.

"Introduction The Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) has a significant impact on the image of the County. The following policies are designed to guarantee current and future projects are maintained at a quality level and capital projects do not restrict the County’s ability to provide basic services. The County must preserve its current physical assets and plan in an orderly manner for future capital investments, including operating costs associated with these projects. In addition to amenity improvements, the County must make the capital investment needed to support and enhance the delivery of basic services. This commitment becomes even more important because the demands for basic services biases funding priorities toward the operating services (sheriff’s office and recreation programs) versus infrastructure (streets and buildings), which could be an issue in the future. Capital expenditures include buildings, land, major equipment and other items which are of significant value and have a life greater than five years. Policies The planning, funding and maintenance of all capital projects will be based on the following policies: 1. **Bond Rating** – The County will maintain a strong bond rating consistent with other County goals. The County will maintain good communications with bond rating agencies about its financial condition. The County will follow a policy of full disclosure on every financial report and bond prospectus. 2. **Five Year Capital Plans** – Each Department with capital expenditures will develop and maintain five-year capital plans.

The CIP lists all anticipated capital expenditures, total estimated cost, the year in which it will be started, the amount expected to be expended in each year, and the proposed method of financing these expenditures. Methods of financing can include bonding, assessment of districts, pay-as-you-go (taxes, current revenues, cash balances), or others. 5. **Include Future Maintenance** – As a part of the annual Capital Budget, the County will identify and include full costs of future maintenance needs and operating costs of new capital facilities and equipment prior to funding as part of the annual Capital Budget. It is essential to recognize many smaller projects can have a significant impact on the existing Staff and maintenance levels when you consider the total impact.
